What is Cross Entropy and KL divergence?Describe KL divergence intuitively.</h3><p><strong>Cross entropy</strong> is, at its core, a way of measuring the “distance” between two probability distributions P and Q. As you observed, <strong>entropy</strong> on its own is just a measure of a single probability distribution. As such, if we are trying to find a way to model a <strong>true probability distribution, P,</strong> using, say, a neural network to produce an <strong>approximate probability distribution Q</strong>, then there is the need for some sort of distance or difference measure which can be minimized.</p><p><strong>Cross entropy function</strong>: <span class="math display">\[H(p,q)=H(p)+D_{KL}(p||q)\]</span></p><ul><li>The first term, the <strong>entropy</strong> of the true probability distribution <em>p</em>, during optimization is <strong><em>fixed</em></strong> – it reduces to an additive constant during optimization.</li><li>Only the parameters of the second, approximation distribution, <em>q</em> that can be varied during optimization – and hence <em>the core of the cross entropy measure</em> of distance is the <strong>KL divergence</strong> function.</li></ul><p><strong>KL divergence</strong> is an expression of “surprise” – under the assumption that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> are <em>close,</em> it is <em>surprising</em> if it turns out that they are NOT CLOSE, hence in those cases the KL divergence will be high. If they are CLOSE together, then the KL divergence will be low.</p><p><strong>KL divergence</strong> is the i<em>nformation gained</em> when we move from a prior distribution <em>Q</em> to a posterior distribution <em>P</em>.</p><p><strong>Derivation of KL divergence</strong>:</p><p>The expression for KL divergence can also be derived by using a likelihood ratio approach.</p><p><strong>The likelihood ratio</strong> <span class="math display">\[LR=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\]</span></p><ul><li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: if a value x is sampled from some unknown distribution, the likelihood ratio expresses how much more likely the sample has come from distribution p than from distribution q. If it is more likely from p, the LR &gt; 1, otherwise if it is more likely from q, the LR &lt; 1.</li></ul><p>Let’s say we have lots of independent samples and we want to estimate the likelihood function taking into account all this evidence – it then becomes: <span class="math display">\[LR=\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}\]</span> If we convert the ratio to <span class="math inline">\(log\)</span>, it’s possible to turn the product in the above definition to a summation: <span class="math display">\[LR=\sum_{i=1}^n\log \frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}\]</span> So now we have the likelihood ratio as a <em>summation</em>. Let’s say we want to answer the question of how much, on average, each sample gives evidence of <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> . To do this, we can take the <em>expected value</em> of the likelihood ratio and arrive at: <span class="math display">\[D_{KL}(P||Q)=\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\log \frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}\]</span> The expression above is the definition of KL divergence. It is basically the expected value of the likelihood ratio – where the likelihood ratio expresses how much more likely the sampled data is from distribution P instead of distribution Q. Another way of expressing the above definition is as follows (using log rules): <span class="math display">\[D_{KL}(P||Q)=\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\log p(x_i)-\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\log q(x_i)\]</span></p><ul><li>The first term in the above equation is the <strong><em>entropy</em></strong> of the distribution P. As you can recall it is the expected value of the <strong><em>information content</em></strong> of P.</li><li>The second term is the information content of Q, but instead weighted by the distribution P.</li><li>This yields the <em>interpretation of the KL divergence</em> to be something like the following: if P is the “true” distribution, then the KL divergence is the amount of <strong>information “lost”</strong> when expressing it via Q.</li></ul><p><strong>Cross entropy</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}H(p,q)&amp; =H(p)+D_{KL}(p||q) \\&amp;= -\sum_{i=1}^nP(x_i)\log (P(x_i))+\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\log p(x_i)-\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\log q(x_i) \\&amp;= -\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\log q(x_i)\end{align}\]</span></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Sroy20/machine-learning-interview-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine-learning-interview-questions</a></p><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/common-loss-functions-in-machine-learning-46af0ffc4d23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Loss functions in machine learning</a></p><p><a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/35928/whats-the-difference-between-error-risk-and-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What's the difference between Error, Risk and Loss?</a></p><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-bias-variance-tradeoff-165e6942b229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff</a></p><p><a href="https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/cross-entropy-kl-divergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An introduction to entropy, cross entropy and KL divergence in machine learning</a></p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: refers to the amount by which &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{f}\)&lt;/span&gt; would change if we estimated it using a different training data set. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;more flexible statistical methods have higher variance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation: different training data sets will result in a different &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{f}\)&lt;/span&gt;. But ideally the estimate for f should not vary too much between training sets. However, if a method has high variance then small changes in the training data can result in large changes in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{f}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bias&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation: As we increase the flexibility of a class of methods, the bias tends to initially decrease faster than the variance increases. Consequently, the expected test MSE declines. However, at some point increasing flexibility has little impact on the bias but starts to significantly increase the variance. When this happens the test MSE increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decomposition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;：The expected test MSE, for a given value &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; can always be decomposed into the sum of three fundamental quantities: &lt;strong&gt;the variance of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x_0)\)&lt;/span&gt;, the squared bias of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x_0)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the variance of the error variance terms &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[
\begin{align}
E(y_0-\hat{f}(x_0))^2=Var(\hat{f}(x_0))+[Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2+Var(\epsilon)
\end{align}
\]&lt;/span&gt; The overall expected test MSE can be computed by averaging &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(E(y_0-\hat{f}(x_0))^2\)&lt;/span&gt; over all possible values of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; in the test set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;support vector machine (SVM)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an extension of the support vector classifier that results from enlarging the feature space using &lt;strong&gt;kernels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;solution to the support vector classifier problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; involves only the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;inner products&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the observations: &lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[
\langle x_i,x_{i^{&amp;#39;}} \rangle =\sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}x_{i^{&amp;#39;}j}
\]&lt;/span&gt; (Details won&#39;t be discussed in this note)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;linear support vector classifier&lt;/strong&gt; can be represented as &lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[
f(x)=\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \langle x,x_i \rangle
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(α_i\)&lt;/span&gt; is nonzero only for the support vectors in the solution—that is, if a training observation is not a support vector, then its &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(α_i\)&lt;/span&gt;equals zero.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we cluster the observations of a data set, we seek to partition them into distinct groups so that the observations within each group are quite similar to each other&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an unsupervised problem because we are trying to discover structure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

These trees are grown deep, and are not pruned. Hence each individual tree has high variance, but low bias. Averaging these B trees reduces the variance.</p><p><strong>Bagging on Classification Tree</strong> - For a given test observation, we can record the class predicted by each of the B trees, and take a <strong>majority vote</strong>: the overall prediction is the most commonly occurring class among the B predictions.</p><p><strong>B</strong> - In practice we use a value of B sufficiently large that the error has settled down, like B=100.</p><h2 id="out-of-bag-error-estimation">Out-of-Bag Error Estimation</h2><p>Recall that the key to bagging is that trees are repeatedly fit to bootstrapped subsets of the observations. One can show that on average, each bagged tree makes use of around 2/3 of the observations. The remaining one-third of the observations not used to fit a given bagged tree are referred to as the <strong>out-of-bag (OOB)</strong> observations.</p><blockquote><p>We can predict the response for the ith observation using each of the trees inwhich that observation was OOB.</p></blockquote><ul><li>This will yield around B/3 predictions for the ith observation.</li><li>To obtain a single prediction for the ith observation, we can <strong>average</strong> these predicted responses (regression) or can take a <strong>majority vote</strong> (classification).</li><li>This leads to a single OOB prediction for the ith observation.</li></ul><p>The OOB approach for estimating the test error is particularly convenient when performing bagging on large data sets for which <strong>cross-validation</strong> would be computationally onerous.</p><h2 id="variable-importance-measures">Variable Importance Measures</h2><p><strong>Bagging improves prediction accuracy at the expense of interpretability</strong> - When we bag a large number of trees, it is no longer possible to represent the resulting statistical learning procedure using a single tree, and it is no longer clear which variables are most important to the procedure</p><p><strong>Variable Importance</strong> - One can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each predictor using the RSS (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini index (for bagging classification trees). - <strong>Bagging regression trees</strong>: Record the total amount that the RSS is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all B trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}RSS=\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{i \in R_j} (y_i-\hat{y}_{R_j})^2\end{align}\]</span> - <strong>Bagging classification trees</strong>: Add up the total amount that the <strong>Gini index</strong> is decreased by splits over a given predictor, averaged over all B trees.</p><p><img src="./11.png" width="600"></p><h1 id="random-forest">Random Forest</h1><p><strong>Random forests</strong> provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a small tweak that <strong>decorrelates</strong> the trees.</p><p>As in bagging, we build a number of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is considered, <em>a random sample of m predictors is chosen as split candidates</em> from the full set of p predictors.</p><p><strong>The split is allowed to use only one of those m predictors.</strong> A fresh sample of m predictors is taken at each split, and typically we choose <span class="math inline">\(m ≈\sqrt{p}\)</span></p><p><strong>Rationale</strong>: - Suppose that there is one very strong predictor in the data set, along with a number of other moderately strong predictors. Then in the collection of bagged trees, most or all of the trees will use this strong predictor in the top split. Consequently, <em>all of the bagged trees will look quite similar to each other.</em> - Hence the predictions from the bagged trees will be highly correlated. Unfortunately, averaging many highly correlated quantities does not lead to as large of a reduction in variance as averaging many uncorrelated quantities.</p><p><strong>Decorrelating</strong> the trees: Random forests forces each split to consider only a subset of the predictors, making the average of the resulting trees less variable and hence more reliable.</p><h1 id="boosting">Boosting</h1><p><strong>Boosting</strong>: another approach for improving the predictions resulting from a decision tree. - Trees are grown <strong>sequentially</strong>: each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. - Boosting does not involve bootstrap sampling; instead each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set.</p><p><img src="./12.png" width="600"></p><p><strong>Idea behind this procedure</strong> - Unlike fitting a single large decision tree to the data, which amounts to fitting the data hard and potentially overfitting, the boosting approach instead <strong>learns slowly</strong>. - Given the current model, we fit a decision tree to the residuals from the model. That is, we fit a tree using the current residuals, rather than the outcome Y , as the response. - We then add this new decision tree into the fitted function in order to update the residuals. Each of these trees can be rather small, with just a few terminal nodes, determined by the parameter <strong>d</strong> in the algorithm. - By fitting small trees to the residuals, we slowly improve <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> in areas where it does not perform well. - The shrinkage parameter <strong>λ</strong> slows the process down even further, allowing more and different shaped trees to attack the residuals.</p><blockquote><p>Note that in boosting, unlike in bagging, the construction of each tree depends strongly on the trees that have already been grown.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Boosting has three tuning parameters:</strong> 1. The number of trees <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. 2. The shrinkage parameter <span class="math inline">\(λ\)</span>, a small positive number. This controls the rate at which boosting learns. 3. The number <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of splits in each tree, which controls the complexity of the boosted ensemble. Often d = 1 works well, in which case each tree is a <strong>stump</strong>, consisting of a single split. In this case, the boosted ensemble is fitting an <strong>additive model</strong>, since each term involves only a single variable. More generally <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the <strong>interaction depth</strong>, and controls the interaction order of the boosted model, since <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> splits can involve at most d variables.</p><p><strong>Boosting V.S. Random forests:</strong></p><ul><li>In boosting, because the growth of a particular tree takes into account the other trees that have already been grown, smaller trees are typically sufficient.</li><li>Using smaller trees can aid in interpretability as well; for instance, using <strong>stumps</strong> leads to an additive model.</li></ul>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap aggregation&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;bagging&lt;/strong&gt;, is a general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical learning method, frequently used in the context of decision trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Averaging a set of observations reduces variance&lt;/strong&gt;: Recall that given a set of n independent observations Z1, . . . , Zn, each with variance &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(σ^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, the variance of the mean &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\bar{Z}\)&lt;/span&gt; of the observations is given by &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(σ^2/n\)&lt;/span&gt;. - A natural way to reduce the variance and hence increase the prediction accuracy of a statistical learning method is to &lt;strong&gt;take many training sets from the population&lt;/strong&gt;, build a separate prediction model using each training set, and average the resulting predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
